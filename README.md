Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? --------
    The goal of the app was to give users the ability to track their weight and to be notified once they have reached their set goal weight. The requirements of this app were to develope code to allow users to sign in. The next was to create a database to display the users weight. And then develope code to prompt the users to allow SMS messaging notifications.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?-------------------------------------------------------------------
  I created a sign in screen that had a button for new users to create an account. This would take them to an account creation screen. I had another screen that was used to request SMS permission from the user if it was there first time signing in. The last screen was the main screen which would show the user weight and date prompts which they could enter in that information. This would add the weights into a list for the user on the main screen.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For me when I was coding the project I had trouble with implementing the database into the app. So what I did was use Zybooks to look at some of the examples they had. And to answer more specific questions I found some guides online that helped with implementing it. This could be used in the future since there are so many resources online that I can find to answer any questions I have.
    
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?---------------------
    What I did for this project was run it on the emulator and use it as intended to. I would go through all the screens and use them. I also tried to break it by using it in a way that was not intended to make sure that my app would not crash when running into issues.
    
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    When I did developed the database for the storing the entered user weight and dates I was thinking of making another database for the username and password information. Which would cause me to have to do a lot more set up to get it started. So what I did was make another table that held sign in information.
    
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I would say it would be the main screen. Mainly because this was the screen that I had to figure out how to implement the database to work with it. Once I figured out how to do that I started then applied that with the sign in information with the sign in screen.
